# OctoAcme Project Management — Overview

OctoAcme applies a structured yet adaptable approach to project management, emphasizing iterative delivery, clear ownership, and continuous improvement. The lifecycle begins with thorough initiation—defining business needs, measurable outcomes, key stakeholders, and success criteria. Foundational deliverables include a Project One-pager, stakeholder list, initial risk and resource assessments, and a clear authorization to proceed. Approved initiatives then move to planning: work is broken into shippable increments, with prioritized backlogs, acceptance criteria, dependency mapping, and resource estimates.

Team roles are well defined and collaborative. Project Managers coordinate delivery, risk, and communication; Product Managers own the product vision, backlog, and measurement of success; Developers implement features, maintain tests and documentation, and help flag technical risks; QA/Testing ensures features meet quality gates and acceptance criteria. Stakeholders provide input and approval at key checkpoints. Communication cadence includes daily standups for progress and blockers, weekly delivery syncs, monthly stakeholder updates, and ad-hoc escalations when necessary. Status reporting, risk registers, and project boards keep progress transparent.

Core workflows follow agile principles: tasks progress through stages like Backlog, Ready, In Progress, QA, and Done on the project board. Pull requests are kept small, must pass automated CI tests and linting, and require documented acceptance criteria linked to the related issue before merging. Quality assurance is layered—unit, integration, and end-to-end tests are complemented by manual QA and CI security scanning. Releases require pre-flight checks, stakeholder communication, rollout plans, and rollback readiness.

Continuous improvement is built into the process. Retrospectives occur after every sprint, milestone, or incident, focusing on what went well, improvements needed, and actionable follow-ups. Action items are tracked and reviewed regularly. By combining disciplined planning, clear roles, robust communication, and ongoing learning, OctoAcme ensures projects remain resilient, deliver customer value, and align with both stakeholder and business goals.
